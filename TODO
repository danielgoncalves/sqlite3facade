TO DO List
==========

In order of importance, I guess.

* Actual make files references hardcoded windows paths. It's evil, I know.
  
* Build scripts are based (only) on windows batch files. It's evil too.

* There's no way to extract source code documentation. It's based on a 
  proprietary documentation tool that, in turn, is based on Java Doc.
  
* A gentle introduction guide will be appreciated.

* My english need some, say, polishing (actually it's horrible).
